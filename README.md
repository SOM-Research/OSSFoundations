Results of our analysis on Open Source Foundations

This project hosts a website that helps you to list, filter and query the list of Open Source software foundations studied in our paper titled [_The Role of Foundations in Open Source Projects_](https://livablesoftware.com/study-open-source-foundations/), published at the [Software Engineering in Society track](https://www.icse2018.org/track/icse-2018-Software-Engineering-in-Society) of the [International Conference on Software Engineering](https://www.icse2018.org") in 2018 and then extended in [A Survey of Software Foundations in Open Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10063).

## Contributing
We would like to keep this list as much updated as possible so feel free to propose new foundations to be added (or propose corrections to the current ones).

Just report an issue and we promise to give you an answer in less than 72 hours :)
