Results of our analysis on Open Source Foundations.

This project hosts a website that helps you to list, filter and query the list of Open Source software foundations studied in our paper titled [_The Role of Foundations in Open Source Projects_](https://livablesoftware.com/study-open-source-foundations/), published at the [Software Engineering in Society track](https://www.icse2018.org/track/icse-2018-Software-Engineering-in-Society) of the [International Conference on Software Engineering](https://www.icse2018.org") in 2018 and then extended in [A Survey of Software Foundations in Open Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10063).

## üõ†Ô∏è Under development

This repo and the website are under development. We would like to make such updates more accesible and also provide a Web API to manage the list.

We would also invite you to report any fix or request via the tradicional GitHub issue mechanism. 

## üë™ Contributing. Help needed!

We would like to keep this list as much updated as possible so feel free to propose new foundations to be added (or propose corrections to the current ones).

Currently, we do not have specific workforce to develop this project so we do it in our free time. We would appreciate any help you can provide.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
